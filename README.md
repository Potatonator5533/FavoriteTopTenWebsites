Favorite Top Ten Websites
Alexander Soria, Josue Rosales
This website contains a top 10 list each selected of our own choosing, with images and videos going along with descriptions of our top 10.

Peer Reviewer: Aiden Foo
Peer Review Notes: The website looks good and works in both Deasktop and Tablet modes, the only thing I would change is the lcation of the Home button from
the top of the page to the bottom with the pagination so also the title won't go onto the next line. But other then that it looks good. Also, filling in the top above the navbar by manipulating the background rectangle would smoothen out the pages, but only do that if you have time.
